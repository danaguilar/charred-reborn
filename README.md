# Charred White

This is a complete front-end remake of the original `Charred` online character builder for the Table Top RPG `Burning Wheel`. It is written completely in Vue so that it can be hosted using Github Pages and will (hopefully) be more satisfying to use. Link to the current version can be found at https://danaguilar.github.io/charred-reborn/.
